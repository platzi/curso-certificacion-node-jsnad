# Task

The `answer.js` file contains the following:

```js
'use strict'

const emitter = require('./emitter')
```

The `emitter.js` file exports an Event Emitter, which is required to the `emitter` variable.

Complete the `answer.js` file to watch `emitter` for any errors.
If an error does occur exit the process with the exit code of `1`.

If no errors occur the process should exit as normal.
