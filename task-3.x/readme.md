# Task

The `answer.js` file contains the following:

```javascript
'use strict'

function answer (command, directory) {

}

module.exports = answer
```

Complete the `answer()` function so that it creates a child process that executes a file
represented by the `file` argument passed to the `answer()` function. Use the `directory` argument to
set the current working directory for the child process. Ensure that the file is executed
synchronously.
