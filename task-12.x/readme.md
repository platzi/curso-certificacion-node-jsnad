# Task

Modify the `package.json` in this directory to depend on the module `colorette`; but not from the registry but from its git repository, using the tagged version `1.4.0` present in the repository.

Once the `package.json` has been updated:

1. Ensure the above package is properly installed in the local `node_modules` directory before submitting your answer.
2. Edit the `answer.js` file to require the module. No other action is needed.
